Here you will find a list of my favorite tools and apps that I use on a daily basis; for work and personal use.

## Development

- For the longest time I was using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). But since :timestamp{date="2025-06-03"}, I have been using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).
- I'm using [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) as my terminal emulator. Previously I was using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) but after a while I found it to be a little sluggish. I also don't like all their AI bloat on top.
- I use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as my default browser. I tried [Arc](https://arc.net/) and [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/), I just can't get used to the vertical tabs. Chrome is also the most performant and stable.
- For some [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) projects I like to use [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/) for a better `php artisan tinker` enviroment. Check it out.
- To manage and interact with my local and remote databases I use [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) with [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/).
- I also use [Proxyman](https://proxyman.com/) from time to time (same developer as TablePlus) for when I need a "network tab" while developing [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) apps.

## MacOS apps

- You should definitely try [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/). It's my favourite app of all time and I use it for many things. For example:
  - Window Management.
  - AI Chat (Yes, I have the Pro subscription).
  - Emoji Picker.
  - Clipboard History.
  - Text Sniping (capture text from an image)
  - And many more things through extensions :)
- For task management in my personal life and miscellaneous work tasks I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com).
- I sometimes take notes in Apple Notes but I like typing in Markdown so thats where [ProNotes](https://www.pronotes.app/) app comes in.

## Desk setup

- I have a Macbook Pro 16' M1 Pro (2021). Which is still blazingly fast!
- For my mouse while gaming I use the [Glorious Model O](https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Model-Gaming-Mouse-Windows/dp/B07LDH3TWM).
- My keyboard is the [Keychron K8 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k8-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard).
