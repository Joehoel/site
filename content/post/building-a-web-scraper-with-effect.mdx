In an app im building I'm displaying some news articles. But their website does not have an external (or even internal) API for retrieving their articles. Some time ago I built it using regular TypeScript running on Deno (deploy). Recently their site was updated so my scraper was broken. This was a good excuse for me to rewrite it in Effect.
